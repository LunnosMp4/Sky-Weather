# Sky Weather

## A very simple Weather Website


This mini project, carried out in 2 days, was intended to introduce me to the basics of the API.<br/>
It was thus at this time that I was able to find out about the usefulness of APIs and learn how to use them !

*Here is a link to the site : [sky-weather.com](https://www.loic-tisseyre.com/sky-weather.html)*

### FUNCTIONALITY

You will find on this site all the following meteorological information:

- Sunrise and Sunset times
- Temperature (current, maximum, minimal, felt)

You will also find a map from the [Windy](https://www.windy.com) API to observe all this data graphically
